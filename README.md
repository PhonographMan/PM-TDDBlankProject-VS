# Blank test project
This is a blank test project for article readers to begin coding without providing full instructions of it's creation.
The reason it exists is to lower friction and ensure the article is not filled with instructions one could look up from Microsoft - which would also be continually up to date.
This code seeks to provide a small project with a few tests which may be played around with or simply viewed to gain further understanding.
## Installation
### Visual Studio
This code was created using **Visual Studio 2022 Community edition**. 
It is likely this would open in Visual studio as far back as 2017 as the project solution files have hardly changed. 
The easiest way to use this code is therefore to open the project in VS2022 using the **.sln**.
### Rider
For Rider, this project should open and has been tested in **Rider 2022. 1 .2**. You will likely need to get the plugin for **Moq** however Rider should notify you of this and give you a nice menu to install.
## Licence
1. I give no guarantee or assurance that the given code will work or will not cause harm.
2. There is no licence for this code. Use it at will even for **commercial use**.
   * This is a teaching project.
